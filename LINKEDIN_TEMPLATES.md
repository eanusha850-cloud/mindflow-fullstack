🔧 Technical Deep Dive: Building MindFlow with Modern Web Technologies

Just completed deployment of my full-stack wellness application, and I'm excited to share some technical highlights!

🏗️ Architecture Decisions:
• React 18 with TypeScript for type-safe frontend development
• Spring Boot 3.5.3 with Spring Security for robust backend
• JWT authentication for stateless security
• H2 in-memory database for rapid development and deployment
• Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion for modern, animated UI

🚀 Deployment Strategy:
• Frontend: Netlify with automatic builds from GitHub
• Backend: Render free tier with Docker containerization
• CI/CD: Automated deployments on every push
• Environment configuration for dev/prod separation

💡 Key Technical Challenges Solved:
1. CORS configuration for cross-origin API calls
2. JWT token management and refresh strategies
3. Responsive design with glassmorphism effects
4. Performance optimization with lazy loading
5. Production deployment with free hosting tiers
